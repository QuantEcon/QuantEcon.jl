Tauchen's (1996) method for approximating AR(1) process with finite markov chain

The process follows

    y_t = μ + ρ y_{t-1} + ε_t,

where ε_t ~ N (0, σ^2)

##### Arguments

- `N::Integer`: Number of points in markov process
- `ρ::Real` : Persistence parameter in AR(1) process
- `σ::Real` : Standard deviation of random component of AR(1) process
- `μ::Real(0.0)` : Mean of AR(1) process
- `n_std::Integer(3)` : The number of standard deviations to each side the process
should span

##### Returns

- `mc::MarkovChain{Float64}` : Markov chain holding the state values and
transition matrix

    # NOTE: I need to shift this vector after finding probabilities
    #       because when finding the probabilities I use a function
    #       std_norm_cdf that assumes its input argument is distributed
    #       N(0, 1). After adding the mean E[y] is no longer 0, so
    #       I would be passing elements with the wrong distribution.
    #
    #       It is ok to do after the fact because adding this constant to each
    #       term effectively shifts the entire distribution. Because the
    #       normal distribution is symmetric and we just care about relative
    #       distances between points, the probabilities will be the same.
    #
    #       I could have shifted it before, but then I would need to evaluate
    #       the cdf with a function that allows the distribution of input
    #       arguments to be [μ/(1 - ρ), 1] instead of [0, 1]

    yy = y .+ μ / (1 - ρ) # center process around its mean (wbar / (1 - rho)) in new variable

    # renormalize. In some test cases the rows sum to something that is 2e-15
    # away from 1.0, which caused problems in the MarkovChain constructor

Accepts the simulation of a discrete state Markov chain and estimates
the transition probabilities

Let S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ} with s₁ < s₂ < ... < sₙ be the discrete
states of a Markov chain. Furthermore, let P be the corresponding
stochastic transition matrix.

Given a history of observations, {X} where xₜ ∈ S ∀ t, we would like
to estimate the transition probabilities in P, pᵢⱼ. For xₜ=sᵢ and xₜ₋₁=sⱼ,
let P(xₜ | xₜ₋₁) be the pᵢⱼ element of the stochastic matrix. The likelihood
function is then given by

    L({X}ₜ; P) = P(x_1) ∏_{t=2}^{T} P(xₜ | xₜ₋₁)

The maximum likelihood estimate is then just given by the number of times
a transition from sᵢ to sⱼ is observed divided by the number of times
sᵢ was observed.

Note: Because of the estimation procedure used, only states that are observed
in the history appear in the estimated Markov chain... It can't divine whether
there are unobserved states in the original Markov chain.
